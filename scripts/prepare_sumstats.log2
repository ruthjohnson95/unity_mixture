  Bumped column 11 to type character on data row 1137900, field contains '.'. Coercing previously read values in this column from logical, integer or numeric back to character which may not be lossless; e.g., if '00' and '000' occurred before they will now be just '0', and there may be inconsistencies with treatment of ',,' and ',NA,' too (if they occurred in this column before the bump). If this matters please rerun and set 'colClasses' to 'character' for this column. Please note that column type detection uses a sample of 1,000 rows (100 rows at 10 points) so hopefully this message should be very rare. If reporting to datatable-help, please rerun and include the output from verbose=TRUE.
